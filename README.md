# Tlacuaches Project

### Is finally back!
This is the second edition of the Tlacuaches project! , last time it was a total success :D

The main idea of this project is to help people to get up to speed on Cloud technologies, I think Mexico has a huge potential on this area and I'd like to contribute with something back.
I'll dedicate one hour per week for 7 weeks period to people who is ambicious enough to learn new stuff and accept new challenges, and probably create an startup or get hired.

I do not consider myself a guru on cloud technologies but I have some experience, resources and friends that can be invited to join us for a session.

I'll provide 
- One hour of my precious life per week for a live session
- A hangouts link
- Challenges, Fun
- Sysadmins, Devs, DevOps to join on some sessions and bright us with their knowledge
- More Fun

This has NO COST, and I do not accept or make any money, this is just a simple FREE initiative.

If interested, you just need to send me an email asking for more details and/or why do you want to be part of this project.
I have only three spots this year!
