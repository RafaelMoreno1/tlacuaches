# Tlacuaches Project

### Is finally back!
This is the second edition of the Tlacuaches project!

The main idea of this project is to help people to get up to speed on Cloud technologies, I think Mexico has a huge potential on this area and I'd like to contribute with something back.
I'll dedicate one hour per week for 7 weeks period to people who is ambicious enough to learn new stuff and accept new challenges, and probably create an startup or get hired.

I do not consider myself a guru on cloud technologies but I have some experience, resources and friends that can be invited to join us for a session.

I'll provide 
- One hour of my precious life per week for a live session
- A hangouts link
- Challenges, Fun
- Sysads, Devs, DevOps to join on some sessions and bright us with their knowledge
- More Fun

**This is FREE as in FREEDOM**, just a simple FREE initiative.

Tlacuaches project is not a product, or a company idea, means it is not run by a company, does not offer support or services, and does not accept or make any money, it's not associated with any cloud provider, platform or any other kind of vendor.

If interested, you just need to send me an email asking for more details and/or why do you want to be part of this project.
**I have only three spots this year!**
