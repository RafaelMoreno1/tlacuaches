## Tlacuaches manifestum

We respect other individuals ideas, culture, and diversity

We live in a constellation of complex systems. It is impossible for any single person
or even any single organization or nation in isolation to understand complex systems.

Collective intelligence — multinational, multiagency, multidisciplinary,
multidomain information-sharing and sense-making —
is the only means of obtaining near-real time understanding of complex systems
sufficient to achieve resilience in the face of changes.

It is in this light that we must recognize that only a restoration of open-source culture,
and all that enables across the full spectrum of open-source possibilities,
can allow humanity to harness the distributed intelligence of the collective and
create the equivalent of heaven on Earth — in other words, a world that works for all.

Clarity (transparency) is the means by which we nurture the recognition and sharing of truth.

Diversity is how our human species will achieve ongoing abundance by liberating human innovation.
Sustainability can only be achieved through mass collaboration and the achievement of panarchy
— a constellation of co-equal hybrid systems of self-governance in which all individuals
freely choose where they wish to be heard, and have full access to all relevant information.

Organized people will defeat organized money every time. We must all come together to begin
a new era that restores the sovereignty of the public in the aggregate over all other forms
of organization and influence.
